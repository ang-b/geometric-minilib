# geometric-minilib
Class-based minimal library for linear geometric control for MATLAB

____

This library is developed for research purposes and aims to provide comfortable and modern access to linear geometric control tools.

Originally intended to be a mixin for the Control System Toolbox, both for sake of development efficiency (don't have time to read through the toolbox interface code) and self-containment, the library mostly uses core MATLAB features, which will hopefully removed in the future, if this project is expanded.

## Dependencies

- Control Systems Toolbox for `designGainLQR`.
